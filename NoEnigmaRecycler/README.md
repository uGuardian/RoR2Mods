# NoEnigmaRecycler
Enigma will never change to disabled items.
Only Recycler by default.

Have you ever had an amusing chain of items going in Enigma, only to be stalled by Recycler and a lack of nearby items? Well no more!
You will still get a target requirement break with royal capacitor though, this is probably a good thing whenever gesture of the drowned gets involved.

Uses IL searching to make EnigmaCompatible for the given item in the item catalog false.
Please @uGuardian on the modding Discord if you encounter any problems with this mod or have any suggestions!

### Changelog

#### 2.0.0:
Configuration has been added, now includes all lunar items (execpt effigy, which is already disabled in vanilla) and Royal Capacitor!
To change this, go into the config and set the item of choice to "false"
