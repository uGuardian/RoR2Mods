# NoEnigmaRecycler
Enigma will never change to Recycler.

Have you ever had an amusing chain of items going in Enigma, only to be stalled by Recycler and a lack of nearby items? Well no more!
You will still get a target requirement break with royal capacitor though, this is probably a good thing whenever gesture of the drowned gets involved.

I may consider making a config to also disable Royal Capacitor, and possibly lunar items in the future.

Uses IL searching to make EnigmaCompatible for Recycler in the item catalog false.
