# NoEnigmaRecycler
Enigma will never change to disabled items.
Only Recycler by default.

Have you ever had an amusing chain of items going in Enigma, only to be stalled by Recycler and a lack of nearby items? Well no more!
The game now only allows a limited number of equipment effects to be active at a time now, this mod doesn't change that.

Custom items can be added via comma delimted list.
Using Perfare AssetStudio will allow you to easily check both vanilla and modded packages by searching "equipmentDef" and checking the "m_Name" value.

Uses On insertion to make EnigmaCompatible for the given item in the item catalog false.
Please @uGuardian on the modding Discord or DM me if you encounter any problems with this mod or have any suggestions!
